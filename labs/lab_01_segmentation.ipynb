Those values are determined empirically, and influence drastically the result of the edge detection. Here, we chose $t_1$=85 and $t_2$=200.\n",

Here, the kernel is a circle of radius 1, which is equivalent to a cross on a 3x3 matrix. To ensure some degree of consistency, the same kernel is used for the subsequent erosion.\n",

Indeed a lot of noise is enhanced by the equalization, to the point where there are way too many false positive when trying to detect the edges with the Canny algorithm. Below are shown the original image, the histogram equalization of that original image, and the edges detected with the Canny algorithm from that equalized image :"
