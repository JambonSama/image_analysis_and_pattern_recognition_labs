Because we fill from the inside of the brain (black), and the brain is closed by closed contours (white), after flood-filling, the brain is white. It is the same function from OpenCV than the one used in the region growing part; but the difference is that here, we do not set the lower and upper difference. Thus they are the default, which is 0.

Since it's easier to get rid of the occular parts later, we chose a value at which the brain is in one piece. Initially, we tried the Otsu threshold, which maximize inter-class variance, and minimizes intra-class variance; but it's just not a good threshold for this application.\n",
