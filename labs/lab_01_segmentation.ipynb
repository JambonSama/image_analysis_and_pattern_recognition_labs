    "<!-- Add your implementation and discussion -->\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to compute the size of the brain using contour detection, we start from the original image, $I_1$, and compute the subsequent images :\n",
    "- $I_2$, by applying the Canny algorithm on $I_1$, the original image. We obtain the contours of the original image. But those contours are not closed, they are just edges from the original image. To determine a region (here, the brain), we need the contour around that region closed (the other contours don't matter).\n",
    "- $I_3$, by dilating $I_2$, the contours. We obtained closed contours, because the dilation of the contours make them grow. Thus, the area containing the brain is determined by a closed contour.\n",
    "- $I_4$, by flood-filling $I_3$, the closed contours, with a initial seed in the brain. We obtain a compound black image, with the closed dilated contours and the brain surface in white. Indeed, flood-filling fills a zone on the basis of a continuous color (or here, lack thereof). Because we fill from the inside of the brain (black), and the brain is closed by closed contours (white); after flood-filling, the brain is white.\n",
    "- $I_5$, by performing the \"NOT\" bitwise operation on $I_4$. We obtain a compound white image, with the closed dilated contours and the brain surface in black. The operations to obtain $I_5$ and $I_6$ are just logical operations on the images, to obtain what we want.\n",
    "- $I_6$, by performing the \"OR\" bitwise operation on $I_3$ and $I_5$. Since $I_3$ contains the closed dilated contours, and $I_5$ anything but the contours and the brain surface, we obtain a white image with the brain surface in black. That brain surface is eroded compared to the real size, because of the previous dilation (of the edges of the brain).\n",
    "- $I_7$, by eroding $I_6$. We obtain a white image with the brain in black, but this time the correct surface. We need this erosion because we had to dilate $I_2$, to close the contours. This dilation \"ate away\" at the brain, so now we need to \"grow it back up\". This is done by erosion because the brain is in black, not in white. \n",
    "- $I_8$, by performing the \"NOT\" bitwise operation on $I_7$. We obtain a mask of the brain surface (brain surface is white on black background).\n",
    "\n",
    "From there, we just count how many pixels are white in $I_8$, the mask, to have the size of the brain in pixels. To verify the quality of the result, we also compute $I_9$, by superimposing $I_8$, the mask of the brain, on $I_1$, the original image. It allows us to assess that the brain surface is indeed correct with visual proof.\n",

Those values are determined empirically, and influence drastically the result of the edge detection. Here, we chose $t_1$=85 and $t_2$=200.\n",

Indeed a lot of noise is enhanced by the equalization, to the point where there are way too many false positive when trying to detect the edges with the Canny algorithm.
