The AFDs are an invariant by translation, rotation and scaling version of the FDs (the Fourier Descriptors). The zeroes are nicely clustered, but since there are two variants for the the ones, we can see two outliers for this class. The ones and zeroes are nonetheless seperable.\n",

    "On the second graph, we have the number of closed loops and the bounding box ratio. We can see that the number of closed loops separates perfectly the numbers 0 and 1. The number 0 has one closed loop and the number 1 has zero closed loops. The bounding box ratio is useless feature with the number of closed loops for distinguishing the zeroes from the ones, because here the seperation is very clear. Nonetheless, with other classes, or very badly written characters, it could gain in usefulness.\n",

In the first one, the number 1 has more peaks on the horizontal projection than on the vertical one (the threshold for the peaks is 5). The number 0 has is more rounded, so it has a similar number of peaks on each projections. It is the expected result, as the number 0 can be seen as a circle and the number 1 as a vertical line. \n",
